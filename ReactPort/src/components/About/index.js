          My names Jake, I just started my Full-Stack Bootcamp back in March of 22' and am looking to finish it up here in May of 22'. I have 10 years of expierence in consumer and business banking. I decided to make a pivot in my career and have been eyeing software development for a long while now and am loving the change. I always knew I had a passion for figuring out complex solutions and problems that no one really wanted to deal with, im glad that programming lets me do this each and every day!
